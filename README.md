# Udacity-MLND-Capstone-Project

This is my final project in Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.

I have chosen Santander Competition dataset from Kaggle. *Link* <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/overview'>Here</a>

The task is to predict the value of target column in the test set.

The dataset is composed of 200k observations and 200 features. You can download the dataset <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/data'>Here</a>

The metric needed to evaluate model performance is the **AUC (Area under de curve)**.
